        Cadence Club is a series of members-only golf events that allows you to
        play public courses without the 5-hour rounds! Cadence Club blocks off
        windows of tee times where only our members (all very quick players) are
        on the course. Additionally, Cadence staff act as starters and rangers
        to ensure a maximum 3.5-hour pace and facilitate "playing through" of
        our fastest groups. Cadence Club ensures that youâ€™ll never be stuck
        behind slower groups. Never wait all-day behind a slow group again!
